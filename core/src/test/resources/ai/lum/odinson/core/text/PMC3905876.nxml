These events require phosphorylation of Elk-1 by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphorylation-dependent interaction of Elk-1 with co-activators, including histone acetyltransferases and the Mediator complex. Elk-1 also recruits ERK to the promoters of its target genes, suggesting that ERK phosphorylates additional substrates in transcription complexes at mitogen-responsive promoters. Here we report that MED14, a core subunit of the Mediator, is a <italic>bona fide</italic> ERK substrate and identify serine 986 (S986) within a serine-proline rich region of MED14 as the major ERK phosphorylation site. Mitogens induced phosphorylation of MED14 on S986 at IEG promoters; RNAi knockdown of MED14 reduced CDK8 and RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment, RNAPII C-terminal domain phosphorylation and impaired activation of IEG transcription. A single alanine substitution at S986 reduced activation of an E26 (ETS)-responsive reporter by oncogenic Ras and mitogen-induced, Elk-1-dependent transcription, whereas activities of other transcriptional activators were unaffected. We also demonstrate that Elk-1 can associate with MED14 independently of MED23, which may facilitate phosphorylation of MED14 by ERK to impart a positive and selective impact on mitogen-responsive gene expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The specific and temporal co-ordination of gene expression is a fundamental process of cell-based life with patterns of gene expression controlling proliferation, differentiation and cell death. Immediate early gene (IEG) expression has revealed how crucial regulatory events revolve around the interface between pathway-specific transcription factors and components of the transcription machinery, involving a plethora of protein interactions and modifications (<xref rid="gkt837-B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>The ternary complex factor (TCF) Elk-1, an E26 (ETS) transcription factor family member, activates transcription of multiple IEGs in response to mitogens, a process initiated upon Elk-1 phosphorylation by the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1 and ERK2 (ERK) (<xref rid="gkt837-B3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Phosphorylation increases the affinity of Elk-1 for Serum Response Element (SRE)-containing promoters, which it engages in a complex with Serum Response Factor (SRF) (<xref rid="gkt837-B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and correlates with desumoylation and derepression of Elk-1 to unleash its trans-activation potential (<xref rid="gkt837-B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). One means by which Elk-1 stimulates IEG expression is through the recruitment of histone acetyltransferases and concomitant alterations in nucleosome positioning, presumably facilitating promoter access and the establishment of pre-initiation complexes (PICs) (<xref rid="gkt837-B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>).</p><p>RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recognizes and engages promoters with the assistance of several basal transcription factors and accompanied by a multi-protein complex referred to as Mediator (<xref rid="gkt837-B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Biochemical and structural analyses have revealed the mammalian Mediator to consist of up to 30 subunits with a mass of &#x0223c;1.5 MD in a head-body-tail arrangement plus auxiliary Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 8 (CDK8) module (<xref rid="gkt837-B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In conjunction with regulatory transcription factors, Mediator appears to co-ordinate phospho-isomerization of the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNAPII that accompanies promoter escape and the switch to elongation (<xref rid="gkt837-B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). The role of the CDK8 module in these events is somewhat controversial, as evidence supports a repressor function at the level of initiation (<xref rid="gkt837-B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) but a stimulatory role during elongation (<xref rid="gkt837-B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Thus the relationship between regulatory transcription factors, Mediator and the CDK8 module has become a major focus of studies on transcriptional regulation (<xref rid="gkt837-B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>).</p><p>Elk-1 appears to communicate with Mediator via interactions with the MED23 subunit (aka Sur2, CRSP130, DRIP130) (<xref rid="gkt837-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). This interaction appears dependent on phosphorylation of Elk-1 and is essential for Elk-1-dependent gene regulation in several contexts, including insulin-dependent adipocyte differentiation (<xref rid="gkt837-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). What remains unclear is the nature of the interaction and its effect on the function of MED23 or indeed Mediator itself. We have shown that ERK is recruited to the promoters of IEGs by Elk-1 and inferred that ERK may phosphorylate additional substrates in PICs assembled on IEG promoters (<xref rid="gkt837-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Here we reveal the Mediator subunit MED14 as a novel ERK substrate, detect Elk-1 interactions with MED14 that are independent of MED23, demonstrate inducible phosphorylation of MED14 at IEG promoters and provide evidence for its positive role in mitogen-responsive gene transcription.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, transfections and extract preparation</title><p>HEK293, HEK293T, HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 U ml<sup>&#x02212;</sup><sup>1</sup> penicillin and 100 &#x000b5;g ml<sup>-1</sup> streptomycin.

Unfortunately, we were unable to ascribe any of these phosphorylation events unambiguously to ERK (unpublished data). However, an alternative candidate approach did allow us to identify ERK substrates at IEG promoters.

In contrast, active versions of Phosphotidylinositol-3OH-kinase (PI3K), Akt/PKB, the small G proteins RhoA, Rac1 and cdc42 and their downstream kinases SEK and PAK activated ERK weakly at best and did not stimulate MED14 phosphorylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt837/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S3</ext-link>).

To test this we performed experiments with MED23<italic>wt</italic> and MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs. In fact the association of MED14 and Elk-1 was equally apparent in MED23<italic>wt</italic> and MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs, even though expression of Elk-1 was somewhat lower in MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt837-F7">Figure 7</xref>d, compare lanes 3 and 5). This result was confirmed with an Elk-GFP fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt837-F7">Figure 7</xref>e). Thus without MED14, MED23 does not contact phospho-Elk, whereas Elk-1 is able to contact Mediator independently of MED23. Moreover, MED14 phosphorylation increases following mitogen stimulation in both MED23<italic>wt</italic> and MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt837/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7b</ext-link>). Nonetheless, Gal-Elk fails to activate reporter expression in response to mitogens in MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt837-F7">Figure 7</xref>f), consistent with MED23 acting in a post-recruitment step (<xref rid="gkt837-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our studies have revealed that active ERK is recruited by Elk-1 into PICs at mitogen-responsive promoters and phosphorylates MED14 on S986. This phosphorylation event at IEG promoters contributes to transcriptional activation, as an alanine substitution at S986 causes significant reductions in Ras-induced and mitogen-stimulated gene expression. Phosphorylation of S986 by ERK may be facilitated by Elk-1 interactions with MED14, which are detected before mitogen stimulation and in cells lacking MED23. Our data are consistent with a role for MED23 in post-recruitment events that may include conformational changes to Mediator induced by phosphorylation of MED14.</p><sec><title>MED14 phosphorylation and structure</title><p>Serine 986 is one of 14 S/TP motifs defining a SP-rich (SPR) domain in MED14 that appears to undergo multiple phosphorylations by hitherto unidentified kinases. All bar one MED14 phospho-peptides identified to date in proteomic screens map to this region. Only 5 S/TP motifs (including S986) conform to the ERK consensus, of the others, three (S1119, S1136 and S1146) are phosphorylated in MV4-11, HCT116 and/or HEK293 cells, as are two adjacent serines (S1133 and S1144) (<xref rid="gkt837-B24" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;26</xref>). Our data establish ERK as the S986 kinase; they also rule out phosphorylation of the SPR domain by CDK8. Importantly, they do not exclude phosphorylation of sites other than S986 by alternative proline-directed kinases. Phosphorylation site prediction algorithms identify 21 high confidence sites, of which 12 are SP motifs. Other kinases predicted to phosphorylate the SPR domain include ATM and IKK (<xref rid="gkt837-B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Thus the SPR domain in MED14 may serve as an integration point for multiple pathways that influence Mediator function.</p><p>Early genetic experiments in yeast complemented by fractionation and reconstitution studies predicted the modular nature of Mediator. EM studies later revealed a three-lobed structure with head, body and tail domains (<xref rid="gkt837-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). MED14, the product of an essential gene in yeast (<italic>Rgr1</italic>), is a core structural component of the tail domain, acting as a scaffold for several submodules defined by MED9, MED10 and MED15 (Gal11). Genetic deletion of Gal11 in yeast yielded a Mediator complex lacking the entire Gal11 module and rendered RNAPII defective for activated but not basal transcription (<xref rid="gkt837-B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Subsequent identification of Gal11 subunits (MED2, 3, 15 and 16) as co-activators for numerous mammalian transcription factors has reinforced the notion of the tail domain as the entry point for regulatory input to the RNAPII holoenzyme. In line with this model, loss of MED24 impairs the incorporation of MED23 into Mediator and vice versa (<xref rid="gkt837-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>).</p><p>Interpretations of interaction studies in yeast inferred that tail domain subunits of the Gal11 submodule (e.g. MED16) contact the C-terminal part of MED14, while regions of MED14 further N-terminal interact with MED9 and MED10 submodules, which form part of the body domain (<xref rid="gkt837-B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Extrapolating from this organization to the metazoan counterpart, the SPR domain of MED14 could provide an articulation point between body and tail of Mediator. Although sequence comparisons provide no clues to domain structures in MED14 and structural data are presently unavailable, the regular distribution of S/TP motifs with a mean spacing of 8.5 and protein structure predictions suggest a domain with conformational flexibility. Nonetheless, recombinant versions of the MED14 SPR domain are soluble and structural studies may be informative.</p></sec><sec><title>MED14 phosphorylation and IEG transcriptional activation</title><p>MED14 participates in hormone-responsive gene expression (<xref rid="gkt837-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Using RNAi we extended its role to include mitogen-responsive gene expression, with induced levels of c-<italic>fos</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> RNA being decreased &#x0223c;50% by a similar degree of MED14 knockdown. In contrast, <italic>Mcl1</italic> expression was unaltered, suggesting that this reduction was unlikely to result from a pleiotropic defect to Mediator. ChIP analyses further indicated that the lower levels of c-<italic>fos</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> RNA correlated with reductions in both CDK8 and RNAPII occupation at the two promoters and a decrease in pS2-CTD density along the genes.</p><p>Reporter gene assays provided evidence for a role of MED14 phosphorylation on S986 in IEG induction. Ras-dependent activation of an ETS-responsive reporter in HEK293 cells increased substantially on co-expression of MED14 but significantly less with the S986A mutant, implicating ERK phosphorylation of MED14 in proliferative gene expression. In addition, we were able to demonstrate a significant dominant-negative impact of the S986A point mutation on Elk-1 transactivation. Again this effect was specific, as no significant difference was observed with analogous reporters for Sap1a, MKL1 or SMAD2/3.</p><p>Phosphorylation of MED14 increased rapidly and substantially at the c-<italic>fos</italic> and <italic>Egr1</italic> promoters after mitogen stimulation (20 - and 4-fold after 30 min respectively), promoters to which Elk-1 recruits ERK (<xref rid="gkt837-B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). These earlier knockdown experiments have now been extended to highlight the role of Elk-1 in MED14 phosphorylation by ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt837-F4">Figure 4</xref>d). On the c-<italic>fos</italic> promoter phosphorylated MED14 was restricted to a peak at the region around &#x02212;30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt837-F6">Figure 6</xref>a), consistent with phosphorylation of MED14 within the recruited RNAPII holoenzyme. Phosphorylated MED14 also accumulated and co-localized with increases in CDK8 recruitment and S5-CTD phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkt837-F6">Figure 6</xref>c). These data are consistent with a model in which ERK phosphorylates MED14 within PICs as a positive post-recruitment step during IEG induction.</p></sec><sec><title>Elk-1 interactions with MED14 and Mediator</title><p>MED23 co-immunoprecipitates efficiently with MED14, so the presence of Elk-1 in MED14 co-immunoprecipitates was anticipated, given the essential contribution of MED23 to the Elk-1-dependent activation of IEGs and the induction of adipogenesis (<xref rid="gkt837-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). However, in contrast to published data, our findings with endogenous proteins in HeLa cells and tagged versions of MED14 and Elk-1 in HEK293T cells indicated that unphosphorylated and phosphorylated Elk-1 interact similarly with Mediator. Moreover, phospho-Elk-1 was co-immunoprecipitated with MED14, but not with MED23, while interactions between MED14 and Elk-1 could be detected equally well in MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; and MED23 <italic>wt</italic> MEFs. To explain the first point we infer that the MED23 antibody immunoprecipitates a pool of free MED23 but is unable to recognize MED23 associated with Mediator. This may have a bearing on the interpretation of earlier work, although the implications of a free pool of MED23 are presently unclear. From the second, we conclude that MED23 is not essential for the interaction between Elk-1 and MED14, nor, apparently, for MED14 phosphorylation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt837/-/DC1">Supplementary Figure S7b</ext-link>), and infer that the crucial role of MED23 is not as intermediary in the recruitment of Mediator by Elk-1.</p><p>Recently, Yin <italic>et al.</italic> showed that MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs were predestined to a smooth muscle cell phenotype, concluding that the absence of MED23 allowed Myocardin-like factors to predominate over TCFs at common target gene promoters (<xref rid="gkt837-B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Our data imply that in MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs Elk-1 would not be precluded from PIC formation at such promoters but would be unable to stimulate post-recruitment events. This scenario is fully consistent with an earlier conclusion that MED23 serves its co-activator function during the post-recruitment phase of transcription (<xref rid="gkt837-B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>).</p><p>MED14 has been linked to transcriptional regulation of hormone-responsive genes in conjunction with MED1. Two transactivation domains of the glucocorticoid receptor cooperate independently with MED1 and MED14 (<xref rid="gkt837-B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Similarly, PPAR&#x003b3;, which was initially shown to require MED1, also interacts with MED14 via its N-terminal domain (<xref rid="gkt837-B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). At present we have no evidence to indicate that Elk-1 interacts directly with MED14. Submodules containing MED9, MED10 and MED16 all contact Mediator via MED14, providing several alternatives, although the absence of MED16 and MED24 from Mediator complexes in MED23&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells appears to exclude them as targets. However, the link between Elk-1 and MED23 is no less enigmatic. The Elk-1 activation domain was shown to bind HeLa Mediator in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, but the interaction was not clearly dependent on MED23 (<xref rid="gkt837-B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Furthermore, no biochemical dissection of the MED23 interaction with Elk-1 has been forthcoming, whereas two <italic>Drosophila</italic> transcriptional activators could be shown to interact directly with a 270aa fragment of dMED23 (48% identical to hMED23) (<xref rid="gkt837-B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). In summary, by whatever means, Elk-1 communicates with Mediator, our finding that an interaction can be established independently of MED23 suggests that the documented association between Elk-1 and MED23 may ultimately prove to be crucial for post-recruitment operations involving Mediator.</p></sec><sec><title>MED14 phosphorylation and Mediator function</title><p>How might MED14 phosphorylation promote IEG transcription? Mediator acts as a central scaffold for PIC assembly, interacting with its dedicated kinase module, the basal transcription machinery and RNAPII (<xref rid="gkt837-B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Thus, modification of S986 may control accessibility to Mediator, by the creation or disruption of a critical docking site. For example, 14-3-3 proteins recognize a range of phospho-serine containing partners; conversely, phosphorylation of the GS- region of TGF&#x003b2;RI blocks binding by FKBP12 (<xref rid="gkt837-B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="gkt837-B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). We did not detect a change in the global association of CDK8 and MED14 upon mitogen stimulation of HeLa cells (accompanied by MED14 phosphorylation), possibly because such changes are likely to be dynamic and restricted to a small fraction of Mediator. Additionally, phosphorylation site mutations in MED14 had no impact on its association with CDK8 (LL and PES, unpublished). However, these experiments did not rule out other changes to CDK8-associated Mediator complexes.</p><p>The conformation of Mediator differs between forms bound to CDK8 and RNAPII (<xref rid="gkt837-B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and it has been shown to undergo structural shifts triggered by interactions with the transactivation domain of p53 that correlated with RNAPII activation (<xref rid="gkt837-B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Conceivably, phosphorylation offers a potent mechanism to influence Mediator conformation. Interestingly, the WW domain-containing protein Pin1 is an isomerase implicated in IEG induction that recognizes phospho-serine/threonines, allowing kinases and phosphatases to exploit conformational change around peptidyl-prolyl bonds (<xref rid="gkt837-B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>).</p><p>Indirect evidence attests to a key role for the SPR domain in MED14 function. Deletion of the SPR domain from MED14 (MED14&#x00394;) generated a mutant that no longer accumulated in the nucleus (unpublished), hence its exclusion from functional assays, suggesting that the SPR domain might be required for MED14 incorporation into Mediator. However, interaction studies in yeast suggest that the SPR domain nestles between regions of MED14 with which diverse submodules interact. It would thus be ideally positioned to engage in post-recruitment conformational changes to Mediator that could result from its phosphorylation by ERK and, potentially, several other kinases. Furthermore, MED14 is just one of multiple ERK targets within Mediator, as MED1 and at least one other Mediator subunit are phosphorylated by ERK (<xref rid="gkt837-B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) (and our unpublished data). ERK recruitment by different transcriptional activators or mechanisms (<xref rid="gkt837-B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) may dictate its target selection within Mediator. Alternatively, multiple contemporaneous phosphorylation events could have a synergistic effect on Mediator conformation unlikely to be abrogated by individual point mutations in a single Mediator subunit. Either way, our demonstration that ERK is recruited into PICs by the activation domain of Elk-1 to phosphorylate the core Mediator component MED14 and promote transcription highlights a new aspect to post-recruitment regulation of IEG expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/nar/gkt837/-/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online, including [50&#x02013;52].</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>The <funding-source>BBSRC</funding-source> [<award-id>BB/D019117/1</award-id> to P.E.S.]; <funding-source>NIH</funding-source> [<award-id>RO1CA117907</award-id> to J.M.E. and M.D.G.] and <funding-source>NSF</funding-source> [<award-id>MCB-1243522</award-id>].
